# Escape

Simple reaction based 2D game.

The goal is to move the cube to one of four directions (up, down, left, right) by following the instructions on screen.

Sounds easier than it is!

## Font

Due to aversion to check out stupid font licenses, I created my own font for this project which is available here: 
[https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1427932/pixel-313](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1427932/pixel-313).
Since I'm not a designer, this is just whats neccessary for this project, nothing more. Feel free to use it anyway.
